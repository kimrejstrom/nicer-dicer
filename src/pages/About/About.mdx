# [RR Starter-kit 2020](https://rr-starter-kit.netlify.com/)

A front-end starter-kit for quickly getting a new UI up and running using React and Redux Toolkit.

This is an in-depth documentation of the technologies
used in the starter-kit and the reasonings behind them.

## Purpose

A batteries included front-end starter-kit for 2020.
This is my personal go-to set of tools for bootstrapping new projects. It quite a bit more than simply some pre-installed packages and a barebones example, as this covers everything from development experience and CI to Github project management and continuous deployment.

## What's included

The RR Starter-kit itself comes with a fully working example application. React and Redux Toolkit (with Typescript) is at the core of this starter kit. The starter-kit is bootstrapped using Create-React-App, and has not been ejected. As the project uses Typescript, ESLint and Prettier have been configured to handle linting and autofixing syntax problems. The project comes bundled with a simple Github workflow for Continuous Integration and default Github Issues and Pull Request templates.

It is out-of-the-box compatible with deployments to static hosting providers such as Netlify and Zeit.

## Project

This section will go through the development experience related parts of the project, from folder structure to npm scripts, Typescript configurations to linting rules.

### Folder structure

Because the starter-kit is making use of a non-ejected Create-React-App (CRA) as it's foundation everything application related is located within the `src` folder.

```
rr-starter-kit/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  .nvmrc
  .prettierrc
  package.json
  postcss.config.js
  tailwind.config.js
  tsconfig.json
  public/
    _redirects
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    index.tsx
    tailwind.css
    api/
    app/
      App.tsx
      rootReducer.ts
      store.ts
    components/
    features/
    pages/
```

- `root`: The application starts in `index.tsx` where we initialize the React application and provide it a store using Redux Toolkit:

```
render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

- `app`: The core of the application is found in the `app` folder.
  Here the `store`, `rootReducer` and `Router` are all configured.
- `api`: This is where the logic to call external services goes.
- `components`: reusable simple components like buttons, alerts etc.
- `features`: more complex features that make us of Redux
- `pages`: navigational pages, the root level component housing the part of the application that lives at that route

### Typescript

The project uses Typescript throughout. Some sensible defaults have been configured in `tsconfig.json`. Most notable addition is using absolute paths for all imports, with `src` as the `baseUrl`. This allows us to do imports throughout the project in the followin way: `import themeReducer from 'features/theme/themeSlice';`. This is more readable and clear than using relative paths.

### ESLint

Extended ESLint to work with Typescript.

```
"eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "eslint:recommended",
      "react-app",
      "plugin:prettier/recommended"
    ],
    "rules": {
      "prettier/prettier": "error"
    }
  },
```

### Prettier

Configured prettier to work correctly with ESLint, autoformatting according to the ESLint rules.

## Stack

### React

There is not much special in the React setup other than the lack of `classes`.
Everything is a component, making use of React `hooks` when needed:

```tsx
export const Header: React.FC = () => {
  // Open mobile menu open
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  ...
}
```

### Redux Toolkit

Used in the demo example to manage the global state, consisting of the
of the fetched remote data: `jokes` and the global dark mode.

With Redux Toolkit the required boilerplate for Redux is kept at a minimum.
The `createSlice` is a function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

```ts
const jokesSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'jokes',
  initialState: jokesInitialState,
  reducers: {
    getJokesStart: startLoading,
    getJokesSuccess(state, { payload }: PayloadAction<Jokes>) {
      const { jokes } = payload;
      state.jokes = jokes;
      state.isLoading = false;
      state.error = null;
    },
    getJokesFailure: loadingFailed,
  },
});
```

### Axios

Axios is used in favor of `fetch` to interface with any external services.
All outgoing request logic is located in the `api` folder.

```ts
export async function getRandomJokes(): Promise<Jokes> {
  const url = `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/ten`;

  const jokesResponse = await axios.get<Joke[]>(url);
  return { jokes: jokesResponse.data };
}
```

The starter-kit is using `redux-thunk` to handle dispatching of async actions. Redux-thunk is the default middleware bundled with Redux Toolkit for handling async actions and side-effects.
Here the `fetchJokes` function is using `async / await` to handle the fetching of remote data:

```ts
export const fetchJokes = (): AppThunk => async dispatch => {
  try {
    dispatch(getJokesStart());
    const randomJokes = await getRandomJokes();
    dispatch(getJokesSuccess(randomJokes));
  } catch (err) {
    dispatch(getJokesFailure(err.toString()));
  }
};
```

### Tailwind CSS

Utility first CSS library that allows you to quickly create any kind of style and components you need without the need to actually write any additional CSS.
Instead of defining a bunch of styles per component, Tailwind encourages you to build re-usable components that make use of the existing utility classes that exist in Tailwind already.

Because the CRA app is not ejected, the CSS processing is done using PostCSS and not Webpack.
There are three main files for any Tailwind project:

- `tailwind.config.js` the main configuration file: here you can extend and modify the base config of Tailwin to suit your needs
- `postcss.config.js` the "build" configuration, here you configure rules for the built production version of your css
- `src/tailwind.css` the only CSS file you need to have in your project. This is where you add any actual CSS classes or modifications to existing Tailwind rules if needed.

## Testing

The starter-kit comes setup with Jest as the test-runner, makes use of Jests own assertion library and uses Enzyme on top of that for shallow render testing of React components.

Shallow rendering allows us to render only the component we are testing without the need to render the entire application tree:

```tsx
it('renders welcome message', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Home />);
  const welcome = <h1 className="text-center">RR Starter-kit 2020</h1>;
  expect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome);
});
```

### Debugging

Debugging in VSCode is super easy with a project bootstrapped using CRA.
This project uses two disting launch configurations for VSCode debugging: one for actual application debugging using Chrome Debugger and the other for debugging tests using the built in debugger in VSCode.

Here are the launch configurations:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug on Chrome",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
      "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
        "webpack:///src/*": "${webRoot}/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Debug Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "args": ["test", "--runInBand", "--no-cache", "--watchAll=false"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
      "env": { "CI": "true" },
      "disableOptimisticBPs": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## CI/CD

The project comes with an automated CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) pipeline built in.
This means that whenever you create a Pull-Request on Github or commit something to `master`. The code is automatically tested and if deemed error-free deployed to production.

### Github Actions

The project is using a Github Workflow with some basic Github actions for automated testing.
The code is checked out, packages are installed (and cached for faster run times) then the code is typechecked, linted and the test suite is run.

If there are problems with the build Github highlights the failed build and notifies you.
If the tests pass the succesful commit will be picked up by Netlify and autodeployed.

### Auto Deployment

Auto deployment to Netlify. This is mostly configured through the Netlify web console: you connect your repository to Netlify, configure a build command, an ouput folder and some deployment rules and after that it just works!
